      months. I can give medication but not water or anything else. I'm not sure
      I can do this, because i'll be resuming work when baby is 6 weeks old. 
      The best I can do is try to stretch it to 3 months. Will this still be
      considered exclusive breasfeeding, and will not being exclusively breastfed
      really affect my baby?`,
